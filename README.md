### （1）How can you run all examples ?
Each of the directories is an independent project, and you can run it in the environment on Python 3.5 and TensorFlow 1.2.1+.

### （2）Why I did this ?
1. The main reason is that I'm building an all-in-one platform for deep learning and need a variety of examples to help me verify the platform's reliability and usefulness.<br/>
2. Simultaneously, many friends hope that I can help them learn deep learning. In order to avoid duplication of work, I sorted out relevant information and placed it on GitHub, so that more people can learn quickly.

### （3）The value of the above examples ?
All of the examples are not commercialized products, but only demo - level examples, limited to learning, and real commercial applications need to be optimized and promoted.

### （4）Attentions.
1. If the data of the training set is infringed or unreasonably used, please tell me that I will delete it in time.<br/>
2. You can use all the code in the samples for free.
